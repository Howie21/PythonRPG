You are Hercules, the greatest of the Greek Heroes! You have been tasked by King Eurystheus to slay the vicious Nemean Lion, defeat the impossible nine-headed Lernaean Hydra, and capture the guard dog of the underworld—Cerberus.

Features:
As a developer, I want to make at least five commits on GitHub with descriptive messages. 

As a user, I want an engaging story to be told using print() statements. 

As a user, I want Hercules (and each enemy), to have health, attack power, and a List of attack names saved in a Dictionary.

As a user, I want the ability to select Hercules’ attack using a menu prompt.

As a user, I want the foe’s attack to be chosen at random.

As a user, I want the results of each attack to be logged in the terminal. 

As a developer, I want to use an Attack() function that will terminate when Hercules or an enemy’s health reaches zero. 

As a developer, I want my RunGame() function to call my other functions in a logical order that will determine game flow.

As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function should do just one thing!  -->

#Step 1:
#Break down process to doable steps

 1. Define Characters using classes
 2. Define user_attack func
 3. Define Monster_attack func
 4. Define encounter engagement
 5. Define Story beginning
 6. Define Story End
 
 
#Step 2:
#Recognize Priority of Functions:

#Step 3:
#Build Functions 
<!-- With Single responsibilties -->
<!--Tells story using print-->

#Step 4:
#Order the Functions in Priority to be called

#Step 5:
#Build a Run function that calls all other functions in priority
